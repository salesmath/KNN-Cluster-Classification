# KNN-Cluster-Classification
This program will take advantage of a KNN cluster classification technique
and model. The goal is to build a KNN classifier using the data set provided
to predict a user favorite video game genre based on age, height, weight, and
gender. The input will be four floating point numbers of age in years, height
in inches, weight in pounds, and gender with female a zero and male a one.
